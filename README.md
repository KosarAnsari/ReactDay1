# 🚀 React - Day 1

Welcome to **Day 1** of my React learning journey!

---

## ✅ What I Learned

Today I learned the basics of setting up and organizing a React project. Here's a summary of what I did:

### 📁 Created a New File in `src/`
- Learned how to create a new component file inside the `src` directory.
- Example: `src/MyComponent.jsx`

### 🔗 Imported the Component into `App.jsx`
- Successfully imported the new component using:
  ```jsx
  import MyComponent from './MyComponent';

  🧠 Key Takeaways
	•	Every React component must start with a capital letter.
	•	Components must be exported using export default.
	•	You can reuse components by importing them where needed.

├── App.jsx
├── main.jsx
└── MyComponent.jsx   ← New file created today

💬 Notes

This is just the beginning! More React concepts coming up in the next days like:
	•	Props and State
	•	Event handling
	•	JSX best practices
